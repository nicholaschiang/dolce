A smaller project.
Something that I could actually build in a weekend.
Similar to [Compound's offer calculator](https://compoundplanning.com/offer-calculator), I could build a potentially viral "brands you can afford" calculator.

Provide your income.
Provide your essential expenses (rent, car payments, insurance, food).

Get a nice visualization of the brands you can afford.
You can share this visualization to social media.
This could make for a fun TikTok trend (b/c almost nobody can afford Loro Piana).

Ex: I make $130k. I save nothing. I can shop at KITH and Aime Leon Dore. I am in the top 5%.
Ex: I make $50k. I want to save 50% of my income. I can only thrift or SHEIN. I am in the top 80%.

Get some knobs you can adjust to see how you can get to the top 1% brands.

Ex: If I ate only rice and saved nothing, I could buy Loro Piana.

This was my original idea.

A classic website that just displays information with a Postgres database behind it.
You can explore the deeply nested world of fashion by simply following links and delving into the black hole.
You can save items to collections for future reference or for sharing with others.

The Postgres database is simply a normalized schema for data scraped from the web (e.g. Vogue, Shopify, WWD).

Essentially idea 3 but a mobile app built with Flutter.

Scrape the same product from many different platforms (retailers, the brand, resellers) and show a pricing comparison (and pricing over time).

## 5

A machine vision solution.
Recognize a product given an image of someone wearing it.
Shazam but for clothing products.

You see a nice outfit on Instagram or TikTok.
You share the post or video to the app.
The app gives you a link to the products in the post or video.
The app gives you equivalents (e.g. if the original products are expensive, you may want to buy the SHEIN equivalents).

This idea could potentially be combined with idea 2.
I could narrow the search to filter for similar products within the brands that a user can afford instead of trying to actually identify the exact product.

## 6

This isn't exactly a product idea.
One of the goals is to make it unto the fashion scene.
I want to sit through a fashion show and appreciate the art.
I suspect becoming a "fashion influencer" could be one way to do that.

@databutmakeitfashion for menswear.
Or, for actually affordable fashion (e.g. what is SHEIN releasing).
Or, for resale and market data (e.g. what brands have the best resale value).
